> Numerical algorithms to integrate some celebrated nonlinear partial differential equations.

This repository includes some finite difference methods to solve the following problems:

- Bour (sine-Gordon)
- Korteweg--de Vries
- Kadomtsev--Petviashvili
- van der Pol pendulum
- nonlinear pendulum
- fractional diffusion (super--diffusion)
- diffusion
- advection 
- Poisson

The code might not perform neither efficiently nor correctly. You are advised to study the theory. Feel free to contribute with corrections, improvements and also with additional methods.
