# finitedifference

Numerical algorithms to integrate some celebrated nonlinear partial differential equations.

This repository includes some finite difference methods to solve:

1) Bour (sine-Gordon)
2) Korteweg--de Vries
3) Kadomtsev--Petviashvili
4) van der Pol pendulum
5) Nonlinear pendulum
6) fractional Diffusion
7) Diffusion
8) Advection 
9) Poisson

All methods are programmed in python. In some cases an iPython (Jupyter) Notebook
is presented so as to interact with numerical solutions.
